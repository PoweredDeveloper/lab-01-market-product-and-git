## My chosen role

Frontend Developer

### Skills I already have
<!-- from roadmap.sh -->
- HTML5, semantic markup, and accessibility basics (ARIA)
- CSS fundamentals (Flexbox, Grid, responsive design)
- JavaScript (ES6+), DOM manipulation, async/await
- A modern framework/library (React) and basic state management
- REST API consumption and basic error handling
- Git version control and collaborative workflows

### Skills I clearly lack
<!-- 4–5 important skills from roadmap.sh -->
- Advanced performance optimization (code splitting, memoization, rendering profiling)
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and E2E with Jest/RTL/Cypress)
- Frontend architecture patterns (scalable folder structures, micro-frontends)
- Security best practices (XSS, CSRF, content security policy)
- Build tooling and bundlers in depth (Vite/Webpack, tree-shaking, module federation)

## Personal reflection

## 1. Chosen Role

**Frontend Developer (React, Middle)**

**Reason:**  
- Your existing skills—HTML/CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React, and REST API consumption—align closely with the core requirements of middle-level React frontend roles.  
- You are already familiar with the tech stack most in demand across the postings (React.js, JS, HTML/CSS).  
- Remote work flexibility and collaborative experience make you a good fit for these positions.

## 2. Comparison of Your Skillset to Market Demands

| Skill Area | Your Level | Market Demand | Gap / Notes |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| React.js / JS frameworks | ✅ Good | High | Strong match |
| JavaScript (ES6+) | ✅ Good | High | Strong match |
| HTML/CSS / responsive design | ✅ Good | High | Strong match |
| REST API integration | ✅ Basic | Moderate | Can improve error handling and advanced API patterns |
| Advanced performance optimization | ❌ Lacking | Moderate | Missing (memoization, code splitting, profiling) |
| Testing (unit, integration, E2E) | ❌ Lacking | Moderate | Testing frameworks like Jest, RTL, Cypress |
| Frontend architecture | ❌ Lacking | Moderate | Scalable folder structures, modular architecture |
| TypeScript | ❌ Lacking | Moderate | Increasingly required in many listings |
| Security best practices | ❌ Lacking | Low–Moderate | XSS, CSRF, content security policy |
| Build tooling (Vite/Webpack) | ❌ Lacking | Moderate | Module federation, tree-shaking |

**Summary:**  
You meet the **core requirements** for a middle React frontend developer (JS, React, HTML/CSS, API usage), but **advanced performance, testing, TypeScript, and frontend architecture** are areas where the market expects more depth. Addressing one or two of these gaps would make you highly competitive.

## 3. Key Skills to Develop This Semester

1. **Advanced Performance Optimization (React-focused)**  
   **Why:**  
   - Performance is a differentiator for middle-level React roles.  
   - Skills like memoization, lazy-loading components, and rendering profiling are directly applicable to the projects you’d work on.  

2. **Comprehensive Testing (Jest/RTL/Cypress)**  
   **Why:**  
   - Many companies now require frontend engineers to write reliable unit, integration, and E2E tests.  
   - Developing testing skills increases your confidence in code quality, makes you more attractive to employers, and complements your React expertise.  

**Optional focus:** TypeScript could also be prioritized if the market or your target companies show strong preference for it, but performance and testing will give the **biggest immediate impact** for a Middle React role.
